<!-- Many songs tell a story. Some stories tell of making songs. Bob Dylan wrote a lot of songs that were poems. Some of his poems were songs. Every song has a story.  -->

Every song has a story. 

And I'm going to tell them.

This one starts with The Beatles, the most well-known band of all-time. I know this because they are currently all over the Internet... 50 years after they've made music. That's 5-0 years. Half a century.

As I'm sure you've heard, the Beatles' music is finally available to stream through music apps such as Spotify and Apple Music. Their tardiness into digital streaming is unsurprising, as they've already been late to the party not once but twice. What is surprising is the size of the splashes they make when they finally do join the party. It seems that pop culture and social media are more than happy to slow down with the new hotness or best of 2015 playlists to talk Beatles. And even update their logos. The amount of attention they are getting is surely a reflection of the quality and diversity of Beatles music. 

This quality and diversity arose out of the cohesiveness of the group and the genius of each individual. However, like most tight-knit groups, the Beatles eventually grew tired of each other. In 1970, the Beatles officially broke up after a tumultuous period. If you've ever heard a joke about Yoko Ono, it's likely regarding her role in the Beatles break up, a role that was influential in the break up but by no means the whole story. 

So, the Beatles were done and there were negative feelings between them. Over the course of the next few years, all of the Beatles' members worked on solo projects, many of which began during their last year together working on Let It Be and Abbey Road. On McCartney's 1971 album Ram, there are a bunch of lyrics aimed at Lennon. In addition, the back cover showed a beetle (get it?) being mounted by another beetle, apparently a reflection of how McCartney felt treated by the rest of the Beatles.

So, Lennon decided to respond with How Do You Sleep?, which might be one of the first diss tracks ever made. And he did not hold back. Listen to the lyrics and see how many of the digs you can catch. My favorite is this:

```
The only thing you done was yesterday
And since you're gone you're just another day
```

He's referencing the hit Beatles song Yesterday written by McCartney, which was, according to McCartney, composed entirely during a dream and quickly played out on the piano upon waking. Another Day is a solo McCartney song which, although good, is a light-hearted pop tune that was likely seen to Lennon as typical McCartney.

On the brighter side, Lennon later noted that the lyrics of How Do You Sleep?, although written from the negative feelings he harbored towards McCartney, were also about himself. He also explained that he had those feelings at the time, but eventually moved on and did not carry those feelings around all the time.

This is the part of the story I lik
