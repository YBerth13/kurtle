why google's cloud makes sense, and how you can get there

Back in the day in the early 2000s, a computer was more than happy to work offline. In fact, so were we. If the aol dial up song wasn't annoying enough, getting kicked offline in the middle of a Napster download was more than enough to send you right back to playing (losing badly at) G-Nome.

But listen, the world has moved on. The internet is mature, and it's pervasive. We are well aware of our need for connectivity when using our smartphones for directions ("No, I will *not* ask for directions, at least not from another human"), checking our twitter feeds, or messaging our friends, but many of us still think that we need our laptops or desktops for when we work offline. The question is, do we actually ever need to work offline?

The answer, *right now*, for most of us, is yes. But barely, and it won't be that way for long. Keep reading to find out why the way in which you think about computers, applications and files is sooo 2012.

Outline


the blurring between native and web
  gmail is accessed from browser on computer, but native app on phone
  device, or type of app (web vs native), not really important in terms of data, more so what is easier, more convenient at that moment?
who is blurring the line?
  google is best, but apple and microsoft also have web app suites
  google seems to have an anser for all my use cases
photoshop as example of a native app that is having a hard time migrating to web
  so some ppl won't be able to go web-only, but that's okay bc they can pick a cmputer based on these offline needs, and google will have no problem being there

#### What is an application?

There are two, general types of applications that we use every day: native applications and web applications. Native applications are installed on your computer or smartphone (which is really just a computer) and the application lives on the device "natively", right beside the other applications that your computer has installed. For example, iTunes is a native application. Since native applications run on top of the computer's operating system, they are not inherently tied to the Internet. They may have the ability to connect to the internet in order to share or receive data (such as the iTunes store tab in iTunes), but they are not reliant upon it to function.

On the other hand, a web application is an application that runs in the web browser. Your web browser is probably Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or even possibly Internet Explorer (I'm so sorry for you). You might be asking yourself, "*Kurt, wtf is a web application. Don't you mean a website? Are you making up this entire blog post?*"

To which I will respond, "Maybe some of it." Just kidding! I'm actually making *all* of it up.

Okay, to get back to your first question, the one about the difference web applications and websites. These definitions are blurry, but for the most part they (can) mean the same thing. Let's take a quick tour of web browsers and websites.

#### What is a website?

Have you ever thought about what happens when you visit a website? Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. 

Let's say you want to visit a website. You open up your web browser. Let's just assume you're cool like me, and you use Chrome. In Chrome, you type in the address to the website, let's say http://www.kurtisawesome.com (not a real website) and hit Enter. Chrome uses it's connection to the internet (probably your home's wi-fi, an ethernet cable, or maybe even the LTE network if you're on a mobile phone) to send a request to that address. Somewhere (specifically "the cloud"... more on this in a bit), a server is listening for incoming requests to that address. The job of this server is to read the request, and then return a response. Request comes in, response goes out. Request, response. Request, response. Pretty sweet life, eh? (Probably not actually... you might have to do that a thousand times a second if you're a facebook server, or sleep most of the day if you're serving this blog). 

Generally, this response back to your computer will include a bunch of files. The browser on your computer takes these files, reads them, and presents them to you. In most cases, the response will contain HTML files (the content) and CSS files (the styles that make it look cool). Back in the day, since internet connections were slow and browsers couldn't load too much data at one time, this was all that it contained. Most websites were just content (text) with links (that took you to more text). 

This is what would generally be considered a website. Just plain old content. Sure, you can click on some links, but there's not much interaction between you and the website. In contrast, a web application is like a website on steroids. Most of the "websites" we use nowadays are really web applications. A good example of this is Gmail. You access Gmail by requesting it at the address http://www.gmail.com, just like a plain old website, but what is returned back to you "feels" a lot like a full-fledged application. You can highlight multiple emails, send them to trash and watch them disappear from your inbox. You can log in and log out. In short, you can interact with it in a similar way that you interact with native applications. 

#### So should I use native or web applications?

As you may suspect, in order to use web applications you need an internet connection. If you are offline, and you try to go to gmail.com, you will find it inaccessible. On the other hand, if you use a native email application, such as Apple's Mail application, you can still open the app without an internet connection. It may even show you the emails you've already looked at, since it stores copies of emails locally, on your computer. But try to send an email without that internet connection? Still won't be able to. Even try and check for new messages? Nope. You see, even though native applications are often faster and more offline-friendly than their web counterparts, they are still require the internet because the data we use/send/download/share/read all comes from the internet.

So, the bottom line is that it doesn't really matter whether you use native or web applications. Both work, and in most cases, even the native apps you use require the internet. The deciding factor should be what's easier, faster, or more convenient. For example, if you have an iPhone and use Gmail as your email platform, then you likely have downloaded the Gmail app for iPhone. The Gmail app is a native application on the iPhone. But when you're on your computer (Mac or Windows or Linux, whatever), you likely just head to gmail.com in your browser.

What you should start to see is that with faster internet and better web browsers, web applications can handle data and user interactions nearly as well as native applications. It should also be clear that what makes an app like Gmail so useful is that the data (the emails themselves) can be access from any computer, anywhere. Since Gmail stores the data (emails) in the cloud, the decision between using a web or native application becomes less important as the decision to store your emails in the cloud in the first place.

Now I bet you're thinking "*Store your emails in the cloud? Obviously! Why the fuck would you store emails on your computer? The whole point is to send emails OVER THE INTERNET to your friends!*"

Woah there, I hear you. Email in general has been a cloud- and web-based utility for a while. But let's think about something that has traditionally been a more computer-based, native utility: Microsoft Word.

#### Word documents in the cloud?

I'm sure all of you have used Microsoft Word at least once in your life. I can remember wayyy back to that annoying little paperclip dude that would pop up and offer me help, even after I told him I didn't need help!

The point is, most of us have thought of documents (text, spreadsheets, presentations) as being local, not cloud-based. We had a native application, such as Microsoft Word, installed on our computer. We saved documents that we made with the native app onto our computer's hard drive. Everything was happening on our computer.

But then we needed to send the document to our friend for revisions. Or submit to our teacher or boss. Or we'd email the PowerPoint slides to ourselves just in case our computer crashed before the presentation. We were hacking our email client to function as a cloud-based document storage.

#### Cloud storage and web apps to the rescue!

Remember how I said that nowadays web applications can handle data and interactions nearly as well native apps? Well the same is true for word processor web applications. They are a tad slower, maybe, and with a few less functions, maybe, but it's more than usable. And only getting better. Gone are the days of being tied to your laptop just because it was the only device with Microsoft Word installed. Screw that! Why not write your documents on your smartphone if you're on the train? Or the web browser if you're on a public computer at a hotel or library?

#### Blurring the lines

Talkj here about how google is the closest the making the web browser an entire computing platform. Talk about increased ability to work offline, caches, etc which brings 

Also how google is really good at storing data in the cloud and syncing across devices.

Maybe also about how websites are becoming web apps in the sense of chrome extensions, chrome apps, chromebook


#### Google to the rescue

Okay, so now it's time for my disclaimer: I really like using Google products and applications, so I'm biased. But by the time I'm finished here, I hope you are convinced that Google is a great solution for almost all of your data. The suite of products they offer, from Google Play Music all the way to Google Docs, covers most of your data and application needs. The great thing, though, is that Google is more compatible than any other cloud platform. By that, I mean that Google's suite of products works anywhere. Have an iPhone? There's google apps (and they're good finally). Have an Adnroid? It's just brimming with Google products, comes pre fucking installed. Have a macbook or a windows computer? USe google chrome as your web browser and you now have access to everyting.
