The other day I was catching up with one of my former mentors from the University of Pittsburgh, discussing my decision to leave science and pursue software engineering. And then it hit me: I'm 6 years old. But not in human years. In human years, I'm 25. But in programmer years? I'm 6. I'm a child. It's a little scary actually; I put in a lot of time in the classroom and laboratory cultivating my skills as a scientist, but I'm a complete noob when it comes to recursive descent parsing or implementing test-driven development into my coding. 

But then, after that realization hit me, I had another realization that hit me even harder. Finally, after wondering why I kept getting hit so hard by all these realizations, I felt relieved. I'm happy to be a 6 year old. I always hear people say how they long to be a child once again. Well, trying to learn how to program sure as hell makes you feel like one, in case you were wondering. 

During my time as a scientist, I worked with a lot of good people. Really good people. They were my mentors, coworkers, classmates, and most important of all, my friends. I wouldn't say I was happy to leave science. Leaving science sucked. Big time. But I'm happier now that I have. In grad school, I started noticing this invading unhappiness in my work. It was an unhappiness inside myself, but it was intimately connected to a much larger unhappiness that was invading students, post docs, techs, everyone. Even the successful post docs (you know, 37 year-old PhDs making $45,000 per year with a successful project) chatted daily about the drag of doing science. At times it was masochistic, mostly it was genuine.

But it was impossible to avoid, the unhappiness. So I left. Handed in my lab coat and got out of Dodge. 

I've had a lot of conversations with a lot of scientists about the current state of academic research, trying to find out what specifically is making it all such a miserable endeavor. I sure as hell have a lot of opinions on the matter. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what I think. If you want to read about the lack of science funding, under paid post-docs, seventh-year grad students, scientific job openings (wait, there are job openings?) or academic dishonesty, a simple Google search will land you more than enough news articles and emotion-laden blog posts. 

So, there's no need for me to add to the corpora documenting all that's wrong with science. It just wasn't working out. It wasn't putting me in a good place, physically or emotionally. So I'm moving on. And it's been great.

In another blog post, I will write about Novel Sense Reader, the app that I made during and after my transition out of science. It turned out to be... not terrible. But at times I felt like an undergraduate researcher trying to complete a post-doc's project. I was learning very quickly *how* to do things, but not full knowing *why* I was doing any of it.

Once I realized Novel-Sense-Reader-as-a-start-up was not practical, I turned my sights to landing a job. But, remember, I'm only 6 in programmer years. So, at this time, I was only 5 and a half!. I needed to learn (a lot of) the basics to even get an interview at any company. 

And so my sights turned once again, this time to Hack Reactor. Besides sounding slightly dangerous, Hack Reactor is a world-renowned programming "bootcamp," designed to take engineers from some skills to all of the skills. And it truly is *world*-renowned, as some of my upcoming classmates are coming from Canada, Italy and Australia. We're going to Hack Reactor's 34th cohort, and from what I can tell the course has been continually improving with each iteration (as should any good piece of software).

I'm sure I'll write more about the program once I actually start (in October). Over the past 6 weeks, I've been working on the pre-course assignments, designed to get us up to speed so we can hit the ground running on day 1. Most of the time I feel in over my head and it continually reinforces my feeling of being 6 years old. But I've embraced this feeling. Two weeks ago, I decided I should learn how to use all 10 fingers and zero eyes when typing (as opposed to my previous habit of four and two, respectively). I think I'm up to about 30 words per minute with minimal mistakes (u and i constantly trip me up). I'm killing it.

I miss science. But I'm having a blast with learning how to use computers to build really cool shit. It's possible science and I will rekindle a relationship down the road at a biotech or start up. For now though, I'm happy with starting something new. When I job search after Hack Reactor I'll be about 6 and a half programmer-years old. It sure as hell beats searching for your first professorship at 37 human-years old.
