Hi there! Thanks for visiting the official blog of... me. Some of you (I estimate 8) have previously read the blog posts I wrote a few years ago when I moved across the country from Pittsburgh to San Francisco. From the city of bridges to the city with one really famous bridge. From steel town to silicon valley. From yinzers to hipsters (and hippies). From holy-crap-when-is-spring-coming to holy-crap-when-did-it-last-rain.

As those 8 of you know, since the original blog from three years ago, I have managed to add one post. One whole post! Clearly, I'm killing it out here. But, please, hold your applause. I've decided it is time to take my blogging game to the next level; it's time to write *at least* two posts a year. I know, I have bold aspirations, but I'm ready for the challenge.

There are a few reasons I want to start blogging again, none of which I'm going to share with you. Just kidding! I'm just not going to share them with you *right now*. I need material for my next post (so I can hit my mark of two blog posts per year). 

I know that right about now you're thinking... "*Kurt, why don't you just continue your old blog? I have it on my Bookmarks Bar and I've been checking once, sometimes twice daily to see if you'd write some new material.*"

Well, not only am I going to blog *more*, I'm going to blog *better*. That's right, I'm going to use my own domain name, customize the styling, and learn how to host my own website; it's probably something I should do since I plan to become a web developer. Also, most of the embedded pictures from my original Blogger posts are no longer there. Although many of the photo captions are fairly comical, some just don't hit home as well without their accompanying pictures. 

So, to answer your question, I suggest you update your bookmark and point it to the new blog. And start checking that shit 3 or 4 times daily.

Again, just kidding! You can easily subscribe to the rss feed and use an rss reader to get *nearly-instant* updates when I post.

I really hope this whole thing isn't going to suck.
