Recently, I gave a talk at Hack Reactor about React and Redux. React is the hot, new JavaScript framework, while Redux is the hot, new flux library that plays nicely with React. More than being new and popular, these tools simplify data management within frontend web apps, resulting in faster, easier and fun(ner) development. 

In this talk, I give a brief overview of the similarities and differences between React and other popular frontend frameworks. Then, I give a short demo on how to build a simple React app. After, I talk about why you might want to use a flux architecture to structure the data within your app, and why Redux is one of the best options for this. Finally, I give a demo of how to set up Redux within a React app.

If you're having any trouble setting up build tools for your React app, you can check out my other <a href="http://kurtle.io/2015/11/29/react-redux-webpack-babel.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> all about this.

Enjoy :)
