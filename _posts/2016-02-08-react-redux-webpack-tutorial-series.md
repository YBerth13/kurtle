If you've been following my blog, well... congratulations! You are awesome. Somehow you've read a bunch of posts of me rambling about code, and kept coming back for more. Truly impressive. This time, however, I decided not to write about code, but talk about it. 

You see, as I described in my last blog post, I gave a talk at Hack Reactor about React and Redux. The staff at Hack Reactor recorded the audio and my screen, and so I threw the talk up on YouTube. I wasn't expecting much from it. 

In just over a month of being on YouTube, it has been viewed over 5,500 times! It's a pretty long video, and the average watch time is only 10 minutes, but that still means that the video has been played for over 50,000 minutes. This isn't Taylor Swift or Adele's 'Hello' status, but it's still not too bad.

I realized that at least some of the info I was talking about was useful for developers. Considering it was only an hour talk, and the audio was less than ideal, I decided to create a more comprehensive video series on the topic. So far, I've uploaded 11 videos, with plans to release a few more. However, the core content is all there.

So, if you would like to learn about React, Redux and Webpack, and see how they can be used to create awesome web apps, this tutorial series is for you.

Enjoy :)
